					For the User Interface Design course at Columbia University I developed a fitness application for users who want to work specifically on their ab muscles. The goal of the application was to help a user plan and create an abs workout specific to their own body type. The users were given the ability to customise their workout for the level of difficulty that they wanted to achieve. Once the user had set their goals they could then workout along with the videos provided.

				<div class="card project1-desc">
					For curating their workout I provided a check box to the user's so that they can easily select/unselect exercise videos that they wanted to add/remove from their workout session. Each exercise had a small video associated with it to help user's understand the exercise they were picking for their workout.

					The user was also given a drag and drop functionality to inter-change the order of the exercises in their planned workout session.

				<div class="card project1-desc">
					I used bold/normal text to highlight the important text on the pages. I also used white spaces to make the application less cluttered and allow user's to concentrate on their main goal of planing a custom workout.

					The user was given an ability to easily navigate through pages and an option to go back at any time to modify their workout. The buttons were highlighted with a black color on the white background to help user's easily navigate through the application and direct them to expected next step in the application.
