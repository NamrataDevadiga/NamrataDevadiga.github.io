					 Abs Blaster is a fitness application for users who want to work specifically on their ab muscles. The goal of the application was to help a user plan and create an abs workout specifically for their own body type. The users were given the ability to customise their workout based on the level of difficulty that they wanted to achieve. Once the user had set their goals they could then exercise along with the videos they had chosen for their workout plan. This application was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and Bootstrap.
